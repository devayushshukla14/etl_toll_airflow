# etl_toll_airflow
This project uses Apache Airflow to implement an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for toll data. The pipeline extracts data from various sources (CSV, TSV, and fixed-width files), transforms the data (e.g., converting text to uppercase), and loads the results into a consolidated output file.
